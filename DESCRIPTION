Description: A flexible stock assessment method for fisheries with developing data collection programs. Requires at least one year of length composition data and assumptions about biological parameters. Can integrate more years of length composition data, a time series of catch, and/or an abundance index. Mixed effects structure accounts for time-variation in fishing mortality and recruitment.
