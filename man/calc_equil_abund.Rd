\title{Calculate abundance at equilibrium}
\usage{
calc_equil_abund(ages, M, F, S_fa, R0)
}
\arguments{
\item{ages}{vector of ages}

\item{M}{natural mortality}

\item{F}{proposed F to calculate reference point, if S_fa has more than 1 fleet, requires F as a vector, one for each fleet}

\item{S_fa}{selectivity by fleet by age}

\item{R0}{recruitment}
}
\value{
vector of expected abundance at age
}
\description{
\code{calc_equil_abund} calculates expected abundance given constant fishing mortality
