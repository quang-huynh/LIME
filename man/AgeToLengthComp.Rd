\item{tyears}{number of years of data}

\item{N_at}{matrix of numbers in the population at each age over time}

\item{comp_sample}{vector of number of individuals sampled each year (set as 1 for proportions)}

\item{sample_type}{a character vector specifying if the length comps are sampled from the 'catch' (default) or from the population}
